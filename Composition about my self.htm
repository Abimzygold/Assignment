  &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I am Adeboye Abimbola, i came from a family of five,in which I am the last born.I am darkskinned.I am also a caring and lovable person,I dont take things or people for granted 
    <p>  &nbsp; &nbsp; Also, growing up as a child was not that tough for me because I was fearless and outspoken althroug my secondary school days.So 'Bully' was not attached to me.</p>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; More so,I love music and dance.So this made me social althrough my secondary school days.I was also loved by all my teachers including those teachers I dont offer their subject.I was also given a prefect post right from my ss2 and I crowned it all as a senior prefect (head girl) in ss3 and this made me so famous and popular.Though the task was gross but I was able to handle it with God.
 <p>  &nbsp;  &nbsp; Lastly, I am in my university days and i hope and pray that God will see me through and make it the best of the best.<br><br>
